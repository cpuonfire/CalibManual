  The manipulator consists of three computer controlled ropes that allow
a source to be positioned within a planer cross section of th acrylic
vessel.  
The source will be moved in one of two orthoganal planes in the
AV by moving the source pendant from one set of ropes to another set.
In total there are seven motor controllers in the system, two side ropes
for each plane (4) plus 3 central ropes that go with each of the three
separate umbilical systems.
